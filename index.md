# About Me

Hellow everyone! My name is **Ihar Shulhan**. I graduated from BSUIR (military faculty, specialized in multichannel telecommunication systems) in 2009. Since then I've worked in several state organization. I don't have any experience as a software engineer in commercial enterprises. But I have profound knowledge of OOP, SOLID and design patterns.
I have some experience in software development in the following languages: 
- C#, ASP.NET;
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript;
- PHP.
  I also have experience in network designing on CISCO hardware and its following configuration and maintenance. I love coding. I am fond of solving problems. So I would like to become a professional software engineer.

## My Interests

- **Reading.** Especially books and articles on programming.
- **Swimming.** I used to go to the swimming pool at least three times a week before taking an English course at MSLU. And now that I   donâ€™t attend English classes any more I would like to take up swimming.
- **Playing volleyball.** Every Tuesday after work my colleagues and I go to play volleyball.
